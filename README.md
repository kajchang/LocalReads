# LocalReads

Simple full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack app that uses a simple React App that allows users to create, read, update and delete books by sending requests to a Express server that interacts with a MongoDB database.

## Installation

Clone this repository.

Install and setup [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).

Install node dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

## Run

It currently only works in development mode, but I'll make a few minor changes in the future for it to be able to server the built files in a production environment.

Run development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
